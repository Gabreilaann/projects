        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are a group of students brought together by our love for coffee and the energy it gives us <br>
            to chase our dreams. Coffee isn't just a drink for usâ€”it's a source of inspiration, motivation, <br>
            and connection. Whether it's helping us power through late-night study sessions, <br>
            sparking creativity in group projects, or simply bringing friends together, <br>
            coffee plays a vital role in our student journey. <br>
            <br>
            Our project is dedicated to exploring the world of coffee, from its rich history to the perfect brewing techniques. <br>
             We aim to share our passion by creating a space where students can learn about different coffee blends, <br>
             brewing methods, and the culture behind every cup. We believe that great ideas start with a great cup <br>
             of coffee, and through this project, we hope to bring people together, one sip at a time. <br>
            <br>
            So, whether you're here for a caffeine boost or just to enjoy the aroma of freshly brewed coffee,
            welcome! Let's learn, sip, and grow together.</p> <br>
