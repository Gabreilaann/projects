        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are a pair of students who have come together through this project, which has been an incredible learning experience for both of us. We want to take a moment to express our gratitude to our professor, Sir Salen, for giving us this opportunity. His guidance and the challenges presented by this project pushed us to dig deeper into the world of coding than we ever expected.</p>
        
        <p>Initially, we had some basic knowledge of coding, but this project truly opened our eyes to how complex and exciting it can be. From working on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to understanding the backend concepts of how a web application works, every aspect of this project challenged us to think critically and creatively.</p>

        <p>We are incredibly grateful for this experience, as it has not only helped us expand our technical skills but also taught us the importance of collaboration, time management, and problem-solving. Through this journey, we have learned that coding is not just about writing code—it’s about problem-solving and constantly learning.</p>

        <p>Once again, thank you to Sir Salen for his invaluable support. We look forward to applying what we've learned to future projects and continuing to grow as developers. Thank you for your attention!</p>
